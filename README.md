# Spyware-Mac-OS-X-C-

A spyware written for Mac OS X in C

// Features

* Creates a launch Daemon on execution, therefore running on startup with root access.
* Creates a python script to email all data collected.
* Takes screenshots aswell as records keystrokes

Note: The spyware has to be run as super user. (Therefore some social engineering is in order)
